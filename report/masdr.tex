% FIRST OF ALL:
% If you are using X-based Emacs to read this file, please switch on
% Syntax Highlighting by typing:
%    ALT-X  font-lock-mode   (or META-X on X-Terminals)
%
% That should make these comments nice and red so they can be easily
% distinguished from the actual code. 
% =======================================================================

% This is a template for  Masters' Theses at WPI.
% It complies (more or less) to the standards given by the Library 
% (as of February 1999)
%
% Feel free to use this file, but I give no guarantee for its compliance
% to standards (meaning I won't pay for the paper if the library rejects it :))
%
%
% The lengths (textheight, width etc.) are fine-tuned for ps1, ps2, and ps3, 
% but seem to be somewhat dependent on the machine you are using to compile, 
% the date, time, moon phase, the weather, and other quantum effects.
% You may have to change \oddsidemargin a little, but it's about 98% correct.
%
% Also, the spacing is correct (doublespacing with footnotes correctly
% singlespaced). Curiously, the font size is not specified in the
% regulations. So feel free to change it, but the majority of theses
% that I have seen is written in 12 point font.
% 
% As for the inclusion of graphics, I recommend the methods specified
% in ``latexguide.ps'' off the CS-GSO Website. You can use other
% methods including copy and paste with a photocopier, but I think
% using the graphicx package is the easiest.
%
% Have fun and good luck with the thesis.

		This project focuses on incorporating two new technologies, drones and software defined radios, to detect and localize relevant wireless signals with increased maneuverability. The objective lies in building a platform for wireless signal mapping for search and rescue purposes. The platform prototype will be a baseline for future development through the recommendations provided in this report.
