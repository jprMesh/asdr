% FIRST OF ALL:
% If you are using X-based Emacs to read this file, please switch on
% Syntax Highlighting by typing:
%    ALT-X  font-lock-mode   (or META-X on X-Terminals)
%
% That should make these comments nice and red so they can be easily
% distinguished from the actual code. 
% =======================================================================

% This is a template for  Masters' Theses at WPI.
% It complies (more or less) to the standards given by the Library 
% (as of February 1999)
%
% Feel free to use this file, but I give no guarantee for its compliance
% to standards (meaning I won't pay for the paper if the library rejects it :))
%
%
% The lengths (textheight, width etc.) are fine-tuned for ps1, ps2, and ps3, 
% but seem to be somewhat dependent on the machine you are using to compile, 
% the date, time, moon phase, the weather, and other quantum effects.
% You may have to change \oddsidemargin a little, but it's about 98% correct.
%
% Also, the spacing is correct (doublespacing with footnotes correctly
% singlespaced). Curiously, the font size is not specified in the
% regulations. So feel free to change it, but the majority of theses
% that I have seen is written in 12 point font.
% 
% As for the inclusion of graphics, I recommend the methods specified
% in ``latexguide.ps'' off the CS-GSO Website. You can use other
% methods including copy and paste with a photocopier, but I think
% using the graphicx package is the easiest.
%
% Have fun and good luck with the thesis.

	% This is the command for doublespacing when you use the setspace
	% package
	% Please do NOT use \baselinestretch, this will mess up everything,
	% cause earthquakes, tornados and lots of questions for me...
	% If you need a singlespaced paragraph (BAD STYLE!!!), use
	% \singlespacing or \onehalfspacing and enclose it together with the
	% paragraph in braces {\singlespacing This is my text... blah blah blah}
	%
	\doublespacing
	
	% Now you can start to be creative.
	% First, you need an abstract.
	% Fortunately, LaTeX has thought of that, so it's very easy:
	%
	\begin{abstract}
		This paper is the most important paper I have ever written. Therefore,
		everyone should read it, like it, and recommend it to all his friends.
	\end{abstract}
	
	% From here on, we need Roman page numbers according to the library
	% regulations. So let's assign those.
	
	\pagenumbering{roman} % or {Roman} if you like them capitalized
	
	% The next thing is the Preface (``Acknowledgements'').
	% No standard environment for that, so we'll format it by hand.

		\textbf{Acknowledgements}
	\end{center}
	
	I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor who made
	sure the thesis has at least 120 pages, 200 pictures and lots
	of formulae and thus made me master \LaTeX{} like my native
	language.
	
	My thanks are also due to my reader... who has read the thesis
	in the two days that I gave him since it wasn't done until two
	days before due date.
	
	Thanks also to ... lots of friends, the fact that a week has
	seven days instead of only five as I had always thought, and
	the fact that I own a key to the building so I can work at four
	in the morning whenever I feel like it. That is, all the time.
