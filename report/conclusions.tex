\chapter{Conclusions}
Introductory paragraph.


\section{Conclusions}
* Made the system
* flew the thing
* logged I, Q data
* Match filtered.
* RSS value.
* GPS value
* Tx/rx working on ground.
* Kalman Filter in MATLAB


\section{Recommendations}
 * Smarter channel measuring/deciding (instead of just reading one).
 * TX/RX in air
 * Kalman Filter Test/implement in C.
 * 5 GHz drone ctl


\section{Future Work}
The primary focus of this MQP was to create an aerial SDR testbed, on which more 
specialized projects can be completed. This is the primary area where future work
could be based. 
 * Drone controller localization 
 * Channel Modelling  \par

In addition to making the platform, the MQP focused on energy detection 
and localization. 
 * Other energy detection techniques
 * Classification. \par

A Kalman filter was implemented in matlab for motion tracking. It was kind of 
working, worked in matlab. 
 * (finish) port to c++
 * test experimentally
 * EKF
 * KF other aspects.
 * Incoroporate other sensors.
