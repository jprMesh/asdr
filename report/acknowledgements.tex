\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

The MASDR team have many people to thank for their unwavering assistance on helping the project become what it is now.  First of all, we would like to thank Professor Wyglinski for all of his help and enthusiasm on our project.  In addition to that, we would like to thank him for letting us test our drone on his property and assisting us with the paperwork in order for us to test at WPI.  We would also like to thank Jon Peck of Gryphon Sensors for his support and guidance in providing us with products that would make our project a success.  In addition to ordering those products, we thank Cathy Emmerton of the ECE office for her prompt ordering of anything that we needed.  Lastly, we would especially love to thank Mead Landis for his kind help and guidance in making a wonderful mounting system.
