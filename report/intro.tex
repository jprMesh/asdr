\chapter{Introduction}
This should ideally contain some text.
\section{First Section.}
More Text.
\subsection[Alternative title for the Table of Contents]{First Subsection.}
Even more text, maybe a formula:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{First Sub-subsection.}

Please remember that you have to compile a document several times when
you did changes that affect figures, table of contents, bibliography,
etc. (This is always the case if you get the warning: ``LaTeX Warning:
Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.'').

The recommended sequence is :

\texttt{latex foo.tex}

\texttt{bibtex foo}

\texttt{latex foo.tex}

\texttt{latex foo.tex}
